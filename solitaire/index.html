<h2>In this game</h2>

<p>
This mobile version of Solitaire contains two games: <i>Klondike</i>, and <i>Spider</i>.
Both of these games are played with cards.
</p>

<h3>Klondike</h3>
<h4>How to play - rules</h4>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)">
<p>
After shuffling, a tableau of seven fanned piles of cards is laid from left to right. From left to right, each pile contains one more card than the last. The first and left-most pile contains a single upturned card, the second pile contains two cards, the third pile contains three cards, the fourth pile contains four cards, the fifth pile contains five cards, the sixth pile contains six cards, and the seventh pile contains seven cards. The topmost card of each pile is turned face up.
</p>
<p>
The remaining cards form the stock and are placed facedown at the upper left of the layout.
</p>
<p>
The four foundations (...) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors. Every face-up card in a partial pile, or a complete pile, can be moved, as a unit, to another tableau pile on the basis of its highest card. Any empty piles can be filled with a King, or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up four stacks of cards starting with Ace and ending with King, all of the same suit, on one of the four foundations, at which time the player would have won.
</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If the player can no longer make any meaningful moves, the game is considered lost. At this point, winning is impossible.</p>

<p>
Klondike has the lowest rates of success of any such game, but this mobile version makes every play winable via the Help system.

<h3>Spider</h3>
<h4>How to play - rules</h4>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_(solitaire)">
<p>
The main purpose of the game is to remove all cards from the table, assembling them in the tableau before removing them. Initially, 54 cards are dealt to the tableau in ten piles, face down except for the top cards. The tableau piles build down by rank, and in-suit sequences can be moved together. The 50 remaining cards can be dealt to the tableau ten at a time when none of the piles are empty.
</p>
<p>
A typical Spider layout requires the use of two decks. The Tableau consists of 10 stacks, with 6 cards in the first 4 stacks, with the 6th card face up, and 5 cards in the remaining 6 stacks, with the 5th card face up. Each time the stock is used it deals out one card to each stack.
</p>

<p>
This mobile version implements the <i>"Spider 1 Suit: Same as classic Spider solitaire, except this game is played with only 1 suit instead of 4, usually Spades."</i> variant, with configurable suit.
</p>
<h4>Scoring</h4>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_(solitaire)">
<p>
Scoring is calculated with a starting score of 500. One point is subtracted for each move (including any use of an undo); 100 points are added for each in-suit stack completed. This allows for a theoretical maximum score of 1254
</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Undo</h1>
<p>
The game features an Undo mechanism for both games. Using Undo makes the game easier to win and allows to experiment with different moves.
</p>
<p>
Using Undo is not required to win the game, it is an optional help.
</p>
<p>
By default, the Undo is limited to 10 usages, which can be replenished by watching an ad, or purchasing Unlimited Undo tokens.
</p>

<h1>Help</h1>
<p>
The game features a Help mechanism for both games. Using Help, you can pick a face down (hidden) card and make it face up (visible).
</p>
<p>
Using Help makes all games winable even if the possible moves have ran out.
</p>
<p>
By default, the Help is limited to 5 usages, which can be replenished by watching an ad, or purchasing Unlimited Help tokens.
